## Tax Considerations

### Single-Member LLC Tax Treatment

**Default:** "Disregarded entity" (IRS treats it like sole proprietorship)

**What this means:**
- Report income/expenses on Schedule C (your personal 1040)
- Pay self-employment tax (15.3% on profits)
- No separate business tax return (simpler)

**Example:**
- Traction makes $10,000 in year 1
- You report $10,000 income on Schedule C
- Pay income tax + self-employment tax
- Deduct expenses (computer, software, hosting, etc.)

### When to Consider S-Corp Election

**If Traction makes $50K+ profit/year:**
- Consider S-Corp election (Form 2553)
- Pay yourself reasonable salary (subject to employment tax)
- Take remainder as distributions (not subject to self-employment tax)
- **Tax savings:** ~$3,000-5,000/year at $50K profit

**For now:** Don't worry about it. File as LLC, default tax treatment. Revisit if profitable.

## Legal Protection (Why LLC Matters)

### Without LLC:
- You personally liable for lawsuits
- Personal assets at risk (house, car, savings)
- "Matthew Scott" and "Traction" are legally the same

### With LLC:
- Traction LLC is separate legal entity
- Lawsuit targets LLC, not you personally
- Personal assets protected (mostly)
- Professional credibility

**Example Scenario:**
- User claims Traction lost their data, cost them job
- Sues for $50,000
- **Without LLC:** You're personally liable
- **With LLC:** They can only sue Traction LLC (which has no assets except the software)

**Is $40 worth that protection? Yes.**
