# LinkedIn Post - Traction Launch

## Version 1: The Raw Truth (Recommended)

**I missed an interview because I lost track of my job applications.**

Not kidding.

107 applications sent since August. Tracked in a CSV file.

October 29: Email from "Hollie Nelson - Interview Request"

Me: *stares at inbox* ...which job was this for?

Searched my spreadsheet. Searched LinkedIn. Searched Gmail.

Found it.

Responded.

Too late.

---

**That moment sucked.**

But it made me build something useful.

**Traction** - A job tracker for people drowning in applications.

Here's how it works:
→ Paste your LinkedIn application list
→ See your response rate instantly
→ Track which job types are working
→ Never lose track again

No login. No BS. Free forever.

---

**The 2025 job market is weird:**

• 13.8M layoffs (highest since 2020)
• 130 applicants per job at top tech companies
• 47% of tech workers actively job searching (up from 29%)
• Response rates: 5-11% for competitive roles

**Translation:** You're sending 100 apps to get 5-11 responses.

**You can't afford to lose track of even one.**

---

**I'm using Traction for my own search.**

My stats:
• 107 applications
• 19% response rate (vs industry 5-11%)
• 1 missed interview (won't happen again)

Built it in 3 hours. Using it every day. Sharing it publicly.

If it helps you land a job, tell me. That's the only metric that matters.

## Version 2: The Frustrated Job Searcher

**The 2025 job market is a dumpster fire.**

Let me explain:

**The paradox:**
• 13.8 million people laid off
• Companies "can't find qualified candidates"
• 130 people apply for every tech job
• Response rate: 5-11%

**The reality:**
You're sending 100 applications.
You're getting 5-11 responses.
You're tracking them in a spreadsheet.
You're losing your mind.

---

**Then you get THE EMAIL.**

"Interview Request - [Company Name]"

**And you think:** ...wait, which job was this?

**You search your spreadsheet.**
**You search LinkedIn.**
**You find it eventually.**

**But you respond too late.**

---

**This happened to me Oct 29.**

107 applications. 1 missed interview. All because I lost track.

**So I built Traction.**

→ Import from LinkedIn (10 seconds)
→ See your response rate instantly
→ Track which job types work
→ Never lose track again

Free. No login. Your data stays on your device.

---

**I'm using it right now.**

My stats:
• 107 applications tracked
• 19% response rate (above the 5-11% average)
• Pattern found: Recruiting agencies = 35% response
• Action taken: More applications to Robert Half, etc.
• Result: More interviews

**The tool works because I need it to work.**

Try it: https://traction-jobs.vercel.app

If 10 people use it, I'll keep building.
If 100 people use it, I'll add Gmail integration.
If 1,000 people use it... we'll make it a real product.

**But right now? It's just me. Building in public. Trying to help.**

## Version 3: The Irreverent One

**Hot take: Spreadsheets are where job searches go to die.**

Evidence:
• Me, August 2025, 107 applications in a CSV
• Me, October 29, email from "Hollie Nelson - Interview Request"
• Me, *frantically searching*, which job was this??
• Me, responding too late
• Me, missing the interview

**Verdict: Spreadsheets suck for job tracking.**

---

**So I built Traction.**

Not because I'm smart.

Because I'm pissed I missed an interview.

**What it does:**
→ Import LinkedIn apps (paste the list, done in 10 seconds)
→ Shows response rate (mine: 19% vs industry 5-11%)
→ Tracks interview rate
→ Prevents the "wait, which company?" moment

**What it doesn't do:**
→ Require login (annoying)
→ Store your data on our servers (we don't have servers)
→ Cost money (it's free)
→ Pretend the job market isn't a mess (it totally is)

---

**The 2025 job market in numbers:**

13.8M layoffs. 130 applicants per job. 47% of tech workers job searching.

**The market is weird. Layoffs everywhere. Companies "can't find talent." You're sending 100 applications.**

**It's not you. It's the market.**

**But you still need to track your shit.**

## Which Version to Post?

**Version 1:** Story-driven, professional, relatable (recommended for LinkedIn)
**Version 2:** Frustrated job searcher, empathetic, validating
**Version 3:** Irreverent, real talk, bold (might alienate some, but authentic)

**My recommendation:** Post Version 1 on LinkedIn (professional platform)

Post Version 3 on Twitter/Reddit (more casual, appreciates irreverence)

**Or:** Post Version 1 Tuesday 8 AM, Version 3 Thursday 5 PM (A/B test)
